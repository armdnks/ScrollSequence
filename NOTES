// total image sequence

// image sequence name, based on asset.xcassets

// getting scroll value

// animation speed

// animation starting point
// we can change the value, depending on how many "image sequences" we have & increase or decrease the "speed" value

// total image count

// logic
// "1 - imageCount" to reverse the sequence
// "imageCount - 1" to get the last image of the sequence
